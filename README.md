# Reece Corkhill's Bootstrap Portfolio
The official portfolio of Reece Corkhill, made with Bootstrap.

## Description

Being a web developer, it's important to be able to showcase your skills. That's why I've developed my portfolio using Bootstrap.

The aim of this project was to create a new version of my existing portfolio, using Bootstrap to give it a better structure and reduce the amount of styling required to acheive the same functionality. The motivation for doing so was so I could showcase my existing work, but with a new design and modernised feel.

The problem was that, in my previous portfolio which was developed using HTML and CSS only, everything had to be built manually from scratch meaning it took a long time to build what, in today's world would be considered a basic website. The solution to this problem was to re-develop my portfolio and keep the functionality the same, but instead using Bootstrap because this uses pre-built components which massively help to reduce the time it takes to build a site and the overall amount of code needed to achieve the end result.
